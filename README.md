## What is it?
An application to make (search and wikipedia) internet queries and results available through SMS messages.

## Why create it?
I crave facts (and sometimes directions...) I don't want to pay for expensive data plans for my whole family.  I am developing this app to make most of my mobile phone internet queries free (minus the cost of an unlimited text plan.)

## Who is this app meant for?
People who want to be able to get simple text information (wikis, internet search, etc...) by querying over SMS and getting the results back by SMS because data is too expensive and they have unlimited SMS.)

## What doesn't it do!
    1. Anything that requires a lot of data! This is created to be a text service...
    2. Provide a public interface...
    The current version of this app requires running your own server.  I plan to provide instructions on how to do this using open-source software(relatively easily and for free.)

## How could you help?
In general, be a good github citizen.
* test the software/provide suggestions.
* actively collaborate  -upload your branch when you make improvements.
